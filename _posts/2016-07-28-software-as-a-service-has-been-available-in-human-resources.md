  Software-as-a-Service has been available in Human Resources for just over a
  decade now. In those ten years, software architecture and delivery has been
  radically altered, evolving more rapidly than in the previous 60 plus years of
  computing. The principles of Cloud Computing, especially in providing
  low-maintenance, scalable access to pools of computing resources, drove not
  only the hardware & network resources (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) from which
  “Cloud” originally sprung, but also SaaS architecture & delivery. From the
  HRIS perspective, we see SaaS as the predominant licensing & delivery model
  for our applications, whether they be silos like Recruiting, Learning
  Management, Succession Planning, etc., or full Enterprise HR systems.
